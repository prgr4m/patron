# Patron

## Overview

Patron is a cli generator for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) inspired by 
[Padrinoâ€™s](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators) generators but 
following flask conventions.

The philosophy behind this cli generator is to provide functionality 
incrementally to a project by generating code from prefab scripts into an 
existing (generated) code base. While other scaffolds provide you with a solid 
base for your flask projects, this tool is more focused on speed of 
development and common patterns generally found in web development so you can 
spend more time writing actual code to solve specific problems.

## Documentation

Can be found on [pythonhosted](http://pythonhosted.org/patron/).

This tooling was originally created for my own personal use and now has been 
open sourced.

## Repository details
Main repo on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/prgr4m/patron) and a mirror 
on [github](https://github.com/prgr4m/patron).
