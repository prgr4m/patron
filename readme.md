# Patron

## Overview

Patron is a cli generator for [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) inspired by 
[Padrinoâ€™s](http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators) generators but 
following flask conventions.

The philosophy behind this cli generator is to provide functionality 
incrementally to a project by generating code into an existing (generated) 
code base. While other scaffolds provide you with a solid base for your flask 
projects, this tool is more focused on speed of development so you can spend 
more time writing actual code to solve specific problems.

## Documentation

Can be found on [pythonhosted](http://pythonhosted.org/patron/).

This tooling was originally created for my own personal use and now has been 
open sourced.

## Repository details
Main repo on [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/prgr4m/patron) and a mirror 
on [github](https://github.com/prgr4m/patron).
