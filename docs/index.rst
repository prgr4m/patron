Patron documentation!
=====================

**Patron** is a cli generator for `Flask`_ inspired by `Padrino's`_ 
generators but following flask conventions.

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org
.. _Padrino's: http://www.padrinorb.com/guides/generators

The philosophy behind this cli generator is to provide functionality 
*incrementally* to a project by generating code from prefab scripts into an 
existing (generated) code base. While other scaffolds provide you with a solid
base for your flask projects, this tool is more focused on *speed* of 
development and common patterns generally found in web development so you can 
spend more time writing actual code to solve specific problems.
