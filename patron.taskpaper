Patron:
My task list of things to do while developing this application since no one has 
opened up an issue :(
	General:
		- patron logo
		- move generators into main package (rewrite but keep old files until end of refactor)
	Cli Parser:
		- argcompletion for linux?
	Project Scaffolding:
		- clean up and remove certain frontend elements offered by frontend addon
	Documentation:
		- feature matrix in regards to padrino but flask conventions
		- roadmap of implementation features
		- list of package dependencies by addon
		- urls pointing to other project documentation for user convenience
		- each feature gets its own page also explaining why I've done things the way they are
		- add commands documentation that are injected by each addon
		- create list of packages being used by each addon and why
	Form Generator:
		- field import injector
	Static Site Generator:
		- add as an addon
	Base:
		- move all things considered front-end out
	Blueprints:
		- if admin addon is present; create admin.py file
	Patron Config:
	Model Generator:
		- shorter commands without losing meaning? explicit is better than implicit...
		- if admin addon present, generate admin.py models... and auto register with admin
		- see if I can shorten it so mccabe doesn't complain
	Front-End Addon:
	Admin Addon:
		- fix admin scaffolding to create media in static directory
		- when adding addon, scan pre-existing directories and auto generate model admins and auto register
	Users Addon:
		- change commands on creating superuser to be able to run more than once
		- remove duplicate delete user command
		- fix delete user command and not delete a role
		- commands should use wtforms for cli validation
	Blog Addon:
		- revise to give user more structure rather than base models and bare templates
		- add whooshalchemy
		- remove until polished
	Injectors:
		- refactor and break out into each scaffolds section
		- make injections user configurable
  Addons:
		API:
			- possibly its own cli subgroup for adding and autoregistration (after addon is present)
			- should have login route
			- httpauth
			- tokens
		Commerce:
			- satchless?
    Mailer:
			- should this use celery? I just don't want to add more development dependencies
		Sitemap:
			- this should be an addon and taken out of the base scaffold
