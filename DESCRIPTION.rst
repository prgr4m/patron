Patron is a generator modeled after the Padrino framework's generators but for
the flask microframework.

The philosophy behind this cli generator is to provide functionality
incrementally to a project generating code from prefab scripts into an
existing code base but does not provide front-end tooling as the front-end
should be separate from the back-end.

The aim for this project is to match Padrino's feature set but following
flask's conventions. While other scaffolds provide you with a solid base for
your flask projects, this tool is for speed and commonality so you can spend
more time writing actual code specific to the problem at hand.
