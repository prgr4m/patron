Patron is a cli generator for Flask inspired by the Padrino framework's 
generators but following flask conventions.

The philosophy behind this cli generator is to provide functionality
*incrementally* to a project by generating code into an existing (generated) 
code base. While other scaffolds provide you with a solid base for your flask 
projects, this tool is more focused on *speed* of development so you can spend 
more time writing actual code to solve specific problems.
